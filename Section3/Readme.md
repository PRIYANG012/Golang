## Struct 
    - Data Structure. Collection of properties that are related together.
    -Example:
        Our Card can be converted into Struct 
        which contains : suit -> <String>
                         value -> <String>

    
## How we define a struct in GO 
    - type <name of Structure> struct {
        vairable declaration
    }

## If we don't assign a struct the values 

    - Go will apply zero Value

    string -> ""
    int -> 0
    float -> 0
    bool -> false
